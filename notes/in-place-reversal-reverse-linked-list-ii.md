# In-Place Reversal - Reverse Linked List II

Tags: linked list

### Question

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return *the reversed list*.

### Ideas

**Classic Reverse Linked List vs. This Problem:**

In the classic "Reverse Linked List," you reverse the entire list. The algorithm is simple because there's no surrounding context to worry about — the new head is just the last node you visited, and the new tail points to `null`.

This problem is harder because you reverse only a **sublist** (positions `left` to `right`). The core reversal logic is identical, but you now have **two boundary connections** to manage:
- The node **before** the reversed section must point to the **new head** of the reversed part
- The **old head** of the reversed section (now the tail) must point to the node **after** the reversed section

**Three-Phase Approach:**

1. **Navigate** — Walk to the node just before position `left` (call it `prev`)
2. **Reverse** — Apply the standard reversal on nodes from `left` to `right`
3. **Reconnect** — Stitch the reversed sublist back into the original list

**Key Insight:** Use a dummy node before `head` so that even if `left = 1`, you always have a `prev` node to anchor to. This eliminates edge-case handling.

**Remembering the reversal loop:** It's just two logical steps repeated:
1. **Flip** — save `curr.next`, then point `curr` backward (`curr.next = prevReversed`)
2. **Advance** — slide both pointers one step forward (`prevReversed = curr`, `curr = next`)

You save before flipping (so you don't lose the forward reference), then advance both pointers. That's it: **save, flip, advance, advance**.

**Reconnection detail:** After reversal, `prev.next` still points to the node that *was* first in the sublist (now the tail of the reversed part). So `prev.next.next = curr` connects the reversed tail to the rest of the list, and `prev.next = prevReversed` connects `prev` to the new head of the reversed portion.

```
Example: 1→2→3→4→5, left=2, right=4

Phase 1 - Navigate to prev:
  dummy → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
          ^   ^
         prev curr

Phase 2 - Reverse nodes 2→3→4:
  Standard reversal builds: 4→3→2→null
  prevReversed = 4 (new head of reversed part)
  curr = 5 (first node after reversed section)
  prev.next still points to node 2 (old head, now tail)

Phase 3 - Reconnect:
  prev.next.next = curr    →  node 2 now points to 5
  prev.next = prevReversed →  node 1 now points to 4

  Result: 1→4→3→2→5
```

### Implementation

```typescript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 *     }
 * }
 */
function reverseBetween(head: ListNode | null, left: number, right: number): ListNode | null {
  if (!head) return null;
  const dummy = new ListNode(-1, head);
  let prev: ListNode | null = dummy;

  for (let i = 0; i < left - 1; i++) {
    prev = prev!.next;
  }

  let prevReserved = prev;
  let curr = prev?.next;
  let next = curr!.next;
  for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
    // save `curr.next`, then point `curr` backward
    next = curr?.next!;
    curr!.next = prevReserved;
    // slide both pointers one step forward
    prevReserved = curr!;
    curr = next;
  }

  // prev.next used to point to the node that was first, now last
  // curr is outside of the range
  prev!.next!.next = curr!;
  // point to the new head of the range
  prev!.next = prevReserved;
  return dummy.next;
}

```
