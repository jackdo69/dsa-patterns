### Question

[LeetCode 994 - Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

*You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:*

- *`0` representing an empty cell,*
- *`1` representing a fresh orange, or*
- *`2` representing a rotten orange.*

*Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.*

*Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.*

### Ideas

This is **multi-source BFS** — rotting spreads from all rotten oranges simultaneously, like ripples from multiple stones dropped in water.

**Why BFS?** Each "minute" is one BFS level. All oranges that rot at the same time are in the same level. BFS naturally processes level by level.

**The approach:**
1. Find all initially rotten oranges → add to queue (starting points)
2. Count fresh oranges
3. BFS level by level:
   - For each rotten orange, rot its 4 neighbors
   - Each level = 1 minute
4. If fresh count reaches 0 → return minutes. Otherwise → return -1 (unreachable)

```
Minute 0:     Minute 1:     Minute 2:
[2, 1, 1]     [2, 2, 1]     [2, 2, 2]
[1, 1, 0]     [2, 1, 0]     [2, 2, 0]
[0, 1, 1]     [0, 1, 1]     [0, 2, 1]
```

**Edge case:** If fresh = 0 at the start, return 0 (no waiting needed).

### Solution

```typescript
function orangesRotting(grid: number[][]): number {
  let fresh = 0;
  const rowSize = grid.length;
  const columnSize = grid[0].length;
  const rotten: number[][] = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < rowSize; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < columnSize; j++) {
      if (grid[i][j] === 1) fresh++;
      else if (grid[i][j] === 2) rotten.push([i, j]);
    }
  }

  const moves = [
    [-1, 0],
    [1, 0],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1]
  ];
  const isValid = (r: number, c: number) => r >= 0 && r < rowSize && c >= 0 && c < columnSize;

  let minutes = 0;
  let head = 0;

  while (head < rotten.length) {
    const size = rotten.length - head;
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const [row, col] = rotten[head];
      head++;
      for (const [x, y] of moves) {
        const newRow = row + x;
        const newCol = col + y;
        if (!isValid(newRow, newCol) || grid[newRow][newCol] !== 1) continue;
        grid[newRow][newCol] = 2;
        fresh--;
        rotten.push([newRow, newCol]);
      }
    }
    if (head < rotten.length) minutes++;
  }

  return fresh === 0 ? minutes : -1;
}
```
