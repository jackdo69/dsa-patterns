# DSA Interview Prep System

A comprehensive, pattern-based approach to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms for technical interviews.

## What's Inside

This repository contains **92 algorithm patterns** designed to help you:
- **Understand** core DSA concepts and how they relate
- **Recognize** which pattern to apply to new problems
- **Practice** systematically at your own pace
- **Master** technical interviews through pattern-based thinking

## Quick Start

### 1. Browse All Patterns
Explore **[quick-reference.md](guides/quick-reference.md)** to see all 92 patterns with triggers, complexity, and code templates

### 2. Understand Relationships & Combinations
Read **[pattern-guide.md](guides/pattern-guide.md)** to learn how patterns connect, combine, and when NOT to use them

### 3. Study Individual Patterns
Dive into `notes/` for detailed explanations and TypeScript implementations of each problem

## Study Approach

### 🎯 Recommended Learning Flow
1. Study pattern from notes
2. Implement from scratch
3. Solve practice problems
4. Review connections to other patterns

### 📈 Building Mastery
- Focus on understanding patterns deeply rather than memorizing solutions
- Practice pattern recognition on new problems
- Learn how patterns combine in complex problems
- Build speed through repeated practice

## Pattern Categories Covered

### Core Data Structures
Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Tries

### Algorithm Techniques
- **Searching:** Binary Search, DFS, BFS
