# Reordering/ Partitioning - Rotate List

Tags: linked list

### Question

Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Ideas

Rotating right by `k` means taking the last `k` nodes and moving them to the front. The key insight is that this is just breaking the list at position `length - k` and swapping the two halves.

Since `k` can exceed the list length, first compute the length and normalize with `k % length` (a full rotation returns the same list). While traversing for length, keep a reference to the tail — you'll need it to connect the old tail to the old head, effectively making the list circular at the right moment. Then walk to position `length - k - 1` to find the new tail, break the link there, and the node after it becomes the new head.

**Why not two-pointer gap?** Unlike remove nth node from end (where `n` is guaranteed valid), `k` here can exceed the list length. The fast pointer would overshoot before establishing the gap, so we'd need the length anyway to normalize `k`. Once we have the length, walking directly to `length - k - 1` is simpler than a two-pointer setup.

### Implementation

```typescript
function rotateRight(head: ListNode | null, k: number): ListNode | null {
  // early return
  if (!head || !head.next) return head;
  // find the length
  let length = 1;
  let curr = head;
  while (curr.next) {
    length++;
    curr = curr.next;
  }
  // normalize k
  k = k % length;
  if (k === 0) return head;

  const tail = curr; // will point to the original head
  // partial traverse
  curr = head; // reset curr
  for (let i = 0; i < length - k - 1; i++) {
    curr = curr.next!;
  }
  const newHead = curr.next;
  curr.next = null;
  tail.next = head;
  return newHead;
}
```
