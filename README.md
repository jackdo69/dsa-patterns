# DSA Interview Prep System

A comprehensive, pattern-based approach to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms for technical interviews.

## What's Inside

This repository contains **75 algorithm patterns** designed to help you:
- **Understand** core DSA concepts and how they relate
- **Recognize** which pattern to apply to new problems
- **Practice** systematically at your own pace
- **Master** technical interviews through pattern-based thinking

## Quick Start

### 1. Understand the Big Picture
Read **[concept-relationships.md](concept-relationships.md)** to understand how all patterns connect

### 2. Browse the Patterns
Explore **[notes/dsa-patterns-index.md](notes/dsa-patterns-index.md)** to see all 75 patterns organized by category

### 3. Practice Pattern Recognition
When solving problems, use **[pattern-recognition-guide.md](pattern-recognition-guide.md)** to identify the right approach

### 4. Learn Pattern Combinations
Study **[pattern-combinations.md](pattern-combinations.md)** to understand how patterns work together

### 5. Before Interviews
Review **[quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md)** - your one-page cheat sheet

## Study Approach

### 🎯 Recommended Learning Flow
1. Study pattern from notes
2. Implement from scratch
3. Solve practice problems
4. Review connections to other patterns

### 📈 Building Mastery
- Focus on understanding patterns deeply rather than memorizing solutions
- Practice pattern recognition on new problems
- Learn how patterns combine in complex problems
- Build speed through repeated practice
