### Question

[LeetCode 110 - Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

*Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.*

*A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.*
### Ideas

A naive approach checks balance at each node by computing heights separately — O(n²). The optimal approach combines height computation and balance checking in a single postorder traversal.

Return `-1` as a sentinel to indicate an imbalanced subtree. At each node:
- If either child returns `-1`, propagate `-1` upward (already imbalanced).
- If the height difference between children exceeds 1, return `-1`.
- Otherwise return the actual height.

This gives O(n) time with early termination — once imbalance is detected, no further computation is needed.

### Solution

```typescript
function isBalanced(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
  function height(node: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (!node) return 0;

    const left = height(node.left);
    if (left === -1) return -1;

    const right = height(node.right);
    if (right === -1) return -1;

    if (Math.abs(left - right) > 1) return -1;

    return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
  }

  return height(root) !== -1;
}
```
