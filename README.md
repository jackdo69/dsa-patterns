## Quick Start

### 1. Understand the Big Picture
Read **[concept-relationships.md](concept-relationships.md)** to understand how all patterns connect

### 2. Browse the Patterns
Explore **[notes/DSA-Patterns-Index.md](notes/DSA-Patterns-Index.md)** to see all 75 patterns organized by category

### 3. Practice Pattern Recognition
When solving problems, use **[pattern-recognition-guide.md](pattern-recognition-guide.md)** to identify the right approach

### 4. Learn Pattern Combinations
Study **[pattern-combinations.md](pattern-combinations.md)** to understand how patterns work together

### 5. Before Interviews
Review **[quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md)** - your one-page cheat sheet

## Study Approach

### 🎯 Recommended Learning Flow
1. Study pattern from notes
2. Implement from scratch
3. Solve practice problems
4. Review connections to other patterns

### 📈 Building Mastery
- Focus on understanding patterns deeply rather than memorizing solutions
- Practice pattern recognition on new problems
- Learn how patterns combine in complex problems
- Build speed through repeated practice

## Pattern Categories Covered

### Core Data Structures
Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Tries

### Algorithm Techniques
- **Searching:** Binary Search, DFS, BFS
- **Two Pointers & Sliding Window**
- **Graph Algorithms:** Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, Topological Sort, Union Find, MST
- **Dynamic Programming:** 11 distinct patterns (1D, 2D, Grid, Knapsack, LIS, LCS, etc.)
- **Backtracking:** Subsets, Permutations, Combinations, Partitioning
- **Greedy:** Intervals, Scheduling, Optimization
- **Advanced:** Monotonic Stack, Prefix Sum, Cyclic Sort, Floyd's Cycle Detection

## How This System Helps

### ✅ Structured Learning
No more random problem solving - follow a proven progression from basics to advanced

### ✅ Pattern Recognition
Learn to identify "this is a sliding window problem" or "this needs DP + Binary Search" in seconds

### ✅ Deep Understanding
Understand WHY patterns work and WHEN to use them, not just memorizing solutions

### ✅ Interview Ready
- Quick reference cheat sheet
- Pattern recognition decision trees
- Code templates for common patterns
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### ✅ Comprehensive Coverage
75 patterns covering all common interview topics and data structures

## Key Features

- **75 Algorithm Patterns:** Complete coverage of interview topics
- **TypeScript Implementations:** Clean, working code for every pattern
- **Pattern Recognition Guide:** Learn to identify which pattern to apply
- **Concept Relationships:** Understand how patterns connect and build on each other
- **Pattern Combinations Guide:** Learn how patterns combine in hard problems
- **Quick Reference:** One-page cheat sheet for interviews

## Success Metrics

As you progress, aim for:
- Deep understanding of core patterns
- Ability to recognize patterns in new problems
- Confidence implementing solutions from scratch
- Understanding how patterns combine

## Learning Philosophy

**Pattern-Based > Problem-Based**

Instead of solving 300 random problems, master 75 patterns that cover ALL problem types. When you see a new problem, you'll think: "This is just pattern X with a twist" rather than "I've never seen this before."

## Resources

- **Pattern Recognition:** Decision trees and triggers
- **Concept Map:** How patterns relate and evolve
- **Quick Reference:** One-page interview cheat sheet
- **Combinations:** Multi-pattern problem strategies
- **75 Pattern Notes:** Detailed implementations and explanations
