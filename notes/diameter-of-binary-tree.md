### Question

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the **diameter** of the tree.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### Ideas

The diameter through any node equals `leftHeight + rightHeight`. The answer is the maximum diameter across all nodes.

Use a postorder DFS that returns the height of each subtree. At each node, compute the diameter passing through it (sum of left and right heights) and update a global maximum. Return `1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)` as the height for the parent to use.

The key insight is that height computation naturally visits every node, so we piggyback the diameter calculation on top of it — no extra traversal needed.

### Solution

```typescript
function diameterOfBinaryTree(root: TreeNode | null): number {
  let maxDiameter = 0;

  function height(node: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (!node) return 0;

    const left = height(node.left);
    const right = height(node.right);

    // Diameter through this node
    maxDiameter = Math.max(maxDiameter, left + right);

    return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
  }

  height(root);
  return maxDiameter;
}
```
